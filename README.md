# StochasticWeightEstimation

This plugin shows a technique for discovering Stochastic Petri Nets from event logs and an existing process model. The plugin name in ProM is "Mine Stochastic Petri net with estimators".

The estimation framework and evaluation is described in "Burke, A, Leemans, S.J.J and Wynn, M. T. (2021) - Stochastic Process Discovery By Weight Estimation", DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-72693-5_20. You can also see this [short blog post](https://adamburkeware.net/2020/10/06/spd-by-weight-estimation.html).

This project, in the ProM repository, is a secondary source and contains only ProM plugin source code. The golden source repository for the project is [spd_we](https://github.com/adamburkegh/spd_we), and includes additional source files for things like running experiments and integrating discovery algorithms at the Java source code level.
